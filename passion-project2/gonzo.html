        <p class="description">Gonzo, aka Gonzo the Great, is the ultimate oddball and a weird, <br> wonderful, and brave soul who lives life on his own terms. Heâ€™s drawn to <br> daredevil stunts and bizarre performance art like playing the bagpipes <br> while balancing upside-down on a unicycle. While his actions may be <br> puzzling, his heart is pure.</p>
