        <p class="description">Rowlf the Dog is the Muppets’ resident piano-playing philosopher. He is cool, kind, and quietly hilarious. He’s the friend you go to for a good laugh, a deep talk, or a soulful tune. Whether he’s cracking a deadpan joke or playing a heartfelt ballad, Rowlf always brings a little class and calm to the Muppet madness.</p>
