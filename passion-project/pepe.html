        <p>Pepe the King Prawn is a sassy, fast-talking Muppet with big dreams and an even bigger personality. He’s part con artist, part comedian, and part flirt, blending street smarts with total absurdity. He’s one of the more recent additions to the Muppet crew but has quickly become a fan favorite.</p>
