        <h3>Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House …</h3>
        <p>As I was reading this reading it made me think about our discussion on the first day of class, all about what we think a website is. Referring to the website as a room, especially as we used a similar house metaphor to describe websites. Viewing a website through the different metaphors gave me a better understanding of things, but it is also important not to restrict the web to one thing because it is many different things.</p>

        <h3>Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology</h3>
        <p>“That's the neat thing about technologies. They're what we can learn to do.” I pulled this quote because I thought it was an interesting way to look at technologies. It’s a perspective I didn’t think about, how tech is not only the machines and computers, but things we learn, like drawing, could be considered a technology by this definition, that’s not a computer, but it's something that is learned and built upon, just like a computer.</p>

        <h3>J. R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h3>
        <p>I thought that the whole connection of  the radio and museum being used to play Modern broadcast makes it not a historical object anymore and applying that to the idea of opening a website in modern browser just crates that temporal paradox I just thought that was interesting cuz it's like I guess it like implies that once you open an old website on a modern browser it doesn't necessarily make it an old website if it's still functions I guess</p>

        <h3>Rediscovering the Small Web</h3>
        <p>A lot of what this reading talked about in multiple points about the homologization of web today and how they missed that back in the 90s how like fun and unique and colorful it was and how they wish that that could be brought back to today just makes me think of the stuff we talked about before about like how the websites look the same how they all prioritize functionality over fun and I just thought that this reading was a fun tie into what we've talked about in class before.</p>

        <h3> Callum Copley - A Friend is Writing</h3>
        <p>
            This reading was very interesting. I liked the discussion of the meaning of different things on the internet, such as the commentary on social media and how it's becoming increasingly involved in our lives, making it hard to separate our lives from social media.  Overall I was more interested in website itself when I first opened it was very intriguing and then starting getting very overwhelming with all the notifications from the different tabs and it was just a whole experience in itself and I liked how the different parts of what was loading, the notifications, the waiting for the text to appear and stuff like that ties back to the writing itself I thought that whole correlation was very cool.
